# Chamuco App — Database Design

**Status:** Proposed
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-14

---

## Database Engine

**PostgreSQL** with JSONB support.

The design philosophy balances relational integrity for core entities with document-style flexibility for sub-entities that naturally belong to a single parent. This avoids over-normalization without sacrificing the queryability and consistency of relational data.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Relational tables for entities with independent existence** — If an entity can exist independently, be referenced by multiple parents, or needs to be queried/filtered across trips, it gets its own table.

2. **JSONB for sub-entities scoped to a single parent** — If data only exists in the context of its parent and rarely needs to be queried independently, it can be stored as a JSONB column on the parent row. Examples: custom fields on an activity, contact info embedded in a stay.

3. **No unnecessary join tables** — Avoid creating association tables unless the relationship itself carries data or needs to be queried independently.

4. **Soft deletes** — Core entities (trips, users, participants) should use soft deletes (`deleted_at` timestamp) rather than hard deletes to preserve audit trails.

5. **Audit fields** — All tables include `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at`.

## Core Entity Overview

> Detailed schemas will be defined per-module as design matures. This section captures the high-level entity relationships.

### Users & Identity
- `users` — Account records. Linked to Google SSO identity.
- `user_profiles` — Extended profile data (bio, avatar, privacy settings). Could be a JSONB column on `users` or a separate table depending on query needs.

### Social / Community
- `groups` — Named collections of users.
- `group_members` — Users belonging to groups (junction table, carries role/permissions).
- `conversations` — Chat threads (direct messages, group chats, trip chats).
- `messages` — Individual messages within a conversation.
- `channels` — Broadcast channels for one-to-many announcements.

### Trips
- `trips` — The central entity. Holds metadata, status, settings.
- `trip_participants` — Users (or groups) invited/confirmed on a trip. Carries attendance status and role.
- `trip_confirmation_rules` — Rules defined by the trip organizer for attendance confirmation (can be JSONB on `trips`).

### Itinerary
- `itinerary_items` — Ordered sequence of events on a trip. Each item references a `movement`, `stay`, or `activity`.

### Movements (Transport)
- `movements` — A transport segment. Includes type (flight, bus, car, ferry, etc.), origin, destination, schedule.
- `movement_reservations` — Booking/reservation status for a movement.

### Stays (Accommodation)
- `stays` — An accommodation record. Includes property name, location, check-in/check-out.
- `stay_reservations` — Booking/reservation status for a stay.

### Activities
- `activities` — A planned activity or experience within a trip.

### Expenses
- `expenses` — A recorded expense. Linked to a trip and optionally to a movement, stay, or activity.
- `expense_splits` — How an expense is divided among participants.
- `expense_settlements` — Records of payments between participants to settle debts.

## JSONB Usage Examples

| Table | JSONB Column | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `trips` | `confirmation_rules` | Custom rules the organizer sets for confirming attendance |
| `trips` | `settings` | Trip-level preferences (visibility, notification preferences, etc.) |
| `movements` | `metadata` | Carrier, flight number, seat info, booking reference |
| `stays` | `metadata` | Check-in instructions, contact info, amenities |
| `activities` | `details` | Custom fields specific to the activity type |
| `users` | `preferences` | App-level user preferences (language, currency, notification settings) |

---

## Naming Conventions

- Table names: `snake_case`, plural (e.g., `trip_participants`, `expense_splits`).
- Column names: `snake_case` (e.g., `created_at`, `trip_id`).
- Primary keys: `id` of type UUID (v4).
- Foreign keys: `{referenced_table_singular}_id` (e.g., `trip_id`, `user_id`).
- Enum columns: stored as `VARCHAR` with application-level validation via TypeScript enums.

---

## Indexes

To be defined per table as schemas are detailed. General rules:

- All foreign key columns get an index.
- Columns used in frequent `WHERE` or `ORDER BY` clauses get indexes.
- JSONB columns that are queried frequently use GIN indexes.
